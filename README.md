bug : (the one that i could see - maybe there is more )
should rotate the screen after submitting the query change to se the list i could not understand
where is my mistake but i am trying to find (if you had any idea i will glad to get that)

improvement : (again the according to my knowledge maybe there is more)
could use just one model instead of two (no need for {userList}) i thought maybe we can use the
fields ...

remained task :
test on flows -> it is new to me i am trying to learn it i will try to update the code on april  (done)

project structure :
i think it is good for small project but according to my research in bigger project presentation
layer will be mess so needs to shrink the project to features then use the current architecture

last note :
1.git revoked the token because i pushed the code and it was in it so i will send the token by email
there is no need for token it will work but for test more than 5 times in a minute with one IP you
will need that com.shahinfasihi.githubsearch.data.remote.GithubApi => TOKEN ------- 2.i start with "
EntireSln" branch and it is a little different with the main after ending the job the i start to
engineering the branch as you said in pdf that you will control the process so i didn't delete the "
entireSln" branch but it shouldn't be there

thanks a lot for your time
